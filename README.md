# HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to give content to a web page and instructs web browsers on how to structure that content.

#### HTML Element ####
An HTML element is a piece of content in an HTML document and uses the following syntax: opening tag + content + closing tag.

```html
<p> Hello World! </p>
```

#### HTML Tag ####

The syntax for a single HTML tag is an opening angle bracket < followed by the element name and a closing angle bracket > . Here is an example of an
opening <div> tag.

```html
<div>
```

#### Element Content ####

The content of an HTML element is the information between the opening and closing tags of an element.

#### Body Element ####

The <body> element represents the content of an HTML document. Contentinside <body> tags are rendered on the web browsers.
Note: There can be only one <body> element in a document.

```html
<body>
<h1> Learn to code with Codecademy :) </h1>
</body >
```

#### HTML Structure ####

HTML is organized into a family tree structure. HTML elements can have parents, grandparents, siblings, children, grandchildren, etc.

```html
<body>
<div>
<h1> It's div's child and body's grandchild </h1>
<h2> It's h1's sibling </h2>
</div>
</body>
```

#### Heading Elements ####

HTML can use six different levels of heading elements. The heading elements are ordered from the highest level h1 to the lowest level h6.

```html
<h1> Breaking News </ h1 >
<h2> This is the 1st subheading </h2>
<h3> This is the 2nd subheading </h3>
...
<h6> This is the 5th subheading </h6>
```

#### Div Element ####

The div element is used as a container that divides an HTML document into sections and is short for ‚Äúdivision‚Äù. div elements can contain flow content
such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, etc.

```html
<div>
<h1> A section of grouped elements </h1>
<p> Here‚Äôs some text for the section </p>
</div>
<div>
<h1> Second section of grouped elements </h1>
<p> Here‚Äôs some text </p>
</ div >
```
#### HTML Attributes ####

HTML attributes are values added to the opening tag of an element to configure the element or change the element‚Äôs default behavior. In the provided example, we are giving the <p> (paragraph) element a unique identifier using the id attribute and changing the color of the default text using the style attribute.

```html
<p id = "my-paragraph" style = "color: green;" > Here‚Äôs some text for a paragraph
that is being altered by HTML attributes </p>
```

#### Attribute Name and Value ####

HTML attributes consist of a name and a value using the following syntax:name="value"and can be added to the opening tag of an HTML element to configure or change the behavior of the element.

```html
<elementName name = "value"> </elementName>
```

#### Unique ID Attributes ####

In HTML, specific and unique id attributes can be assigned to different elements in order to differentiate between them.When needed, the id value can be called upon by CSS and JavaScript to manipulate, format, and perform specific instructions on that element and that element only. Valid id attributes should begin with a letter and should onlycontain letters ( a-Z ), digits ( 0-9 ), hyphens ( - ), underscores ( _ ), and periods( . ).

```html
<h1 id= "A1"> Hello World </h1>
```

#### Paragraph Element ####

The <p> paragraph element contains and displays a block of text.

#### Span Element ####

The <span> element is an inline container for text and can be used to group text for styling purposes. However, as <span> is a generic container to
separate pieces of text from a larger body of text, its use should be avoided if a more semantic element is available.

```html
<p> <span> This text </span> may be styled differently than the surrounding text.</p>
```
#### Emphasis Element ####

The <em> emphasis element emphasizes text and browsers will usually italicize the emphasized text by default.

#### Strong Element ####

The <strong> element highlights important, serious, or urgent text and browsers will normally render this highlighted text in bold by default.

#### Line Break Element ####

The br line break element will create a line break in text and is especially useful where a division of text is required, like in a postal address. The line
break element requires only an opening tag and must not have a closing tag.

#### List Item Element ####

The li list item element create list items inside:
1. Unordered lists ul
2. Ordered lists ol

#### Unordered List Element ####

The ul unordered list element is used to create a list of items in no particular order. Each individual list item will have a bullet point by default.

```html
<ul>
<li> Play more music üé∏ </li>
<li> Read more books üìö </li>
</ul>
```
#### Ordered List Element ####

The ol ordered list element creates a list of items in sequential order. Each list item appears numbered by default.

```html
< ol >
< li > Preheat oven to 325 F üë© üç≥ </ li >
< li > Drop cookie dough üç™ </ li >
< li > Bake for 15 min ‚è∞ </ li >
</ ol >
```

#### Image Element ####

HTML image <img> elements embed images in documents. The src attribute contains the image URL and is mandatory. <img> is an empty element meaning
it should not have a closing tag.

```html
< img src = "image.png" >
```

#### Attribute ####

An <img> element can have alternative text via the alt attribute. The alternative text will be displayed if an image fails to render due to an incorrect
URL, if the image format is not supported by the browser, if the image is blocked from being displayed, or if the image has not been received from the
URL.The text will be read aloud if screen reading software is used and helps support visually impaired users by providing a text descriptor for the image
content on a webpage.

```html
< img src = "path/to/image" alt = "text describing image" />
```

#### Video Element ####

The <video> element embeds a media player for video playback. The src attribute will contain the URL to the video. Adding the controls attribute will
display video controls in the media player.
Note: The content inside the opening and closing tag is shown as a fallback in
browsers that don‚Äôt support the element.

```html
< video src = "test-video.mp4" controls >
Video not supported
</ video >
```

#### Document Type Declaration ####
The document type declaration <!DOCTYPE html> is required as the first line of an HTML document. The doctype declaration is an instruction to the browser
about what type of document to expect and which version of HTML is being used, in this case it‚Äôs HTML5.

#### Anchor Element ####

The <a> anchor element is used to create hyperlinks in an HTML document.The hyperlinks can point to other webpages, files on the same server, a
location on the same page, or any other URL via the hyperlink reference attribute, href . The href determines the location the anchor element points
to.
```html
< a href = "codecademy.com" > Visit this site </ a >
```

#### Target Attribute ####

The target attribute on an <a> anchor element specifies where a hyperlink should be opened. A target value of "_blank" will tell the browser to open the
hyperlink in a new tab in modern browsers, or in a new window in older browsers or if the browser has had settings changed to open hyperlinks in a new window.

```html
< a href = "https://www.google.com" target = "_blank" > google </ a >
```

#### File Path ####

URL paths in HTML can be absolute paths, like a full URL, for example:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn
or a relative file path that linksto a local file in the same folder or on the same server, for example:./style.css

#### Whitespace ####

Whitespace, such as line breaks, added to an HTML document between block-level elements will generally be ignored by the browser and are not added to
increase spacing on the rendered HTML page. Rather, whitespace is added for organization and easier reading of the HTML document itself.

#### Comments ####

In HTML, comments can be added between an opening <!-- and closing --> .Content inside of comments will not be rendered by browsers, and are usually
used to describe a part of code or provide other details.Comments can be single or multiple lines.
